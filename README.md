# DH2016

This repository contains the documents that will be edited during the CTS Workshop at the DH 2016 Conference in Krakow.

The steps to make these texts CapiTainS compliant are:

    Rename the files (ger0001.ger001.opp-{ger,fre}1.xml)
    Create Repository structure (data/ger0001/ger001/)
    Run HookTests
    Create the __cts__.xml metadata file for the text group ger0001
    Run HookTests
    Create the __cts__.xml metadata file for the work group ger001
    Run HookTests
    Add URN to ger0001.ger001.opp-ger1.xml
    Run HookTests
    Add line numbers
    Add refsDecl
    Run HookTests
    Check out Nemo!

The finished texts and repository structure will be added after the workshop is finished.
